# Webhook Delivery Service

A robust backend system for managing webhook subscriptions, ingesting and delivering webhooks asynchronously with retries, signature verification, logging, caching, and status tracking.

#### üåê Live Demo - [Backend Service]([https://newshub-c5r7.onrender.com](https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/docs))

## Features
  * Subscription Management (CRUD)
  * Asynchronous Webhook Ingestion and Delivery
  * HMAC-SHA256 Signature Verification
  * Delivery Logging with Retry (Exponential Backoff)
  * Caching with Redis (Upstash)
  * Log Retention Cleanup
  * Status & Analytics Endpoints
  * Dockerized (with docker-compose)
  * Deployed on Render + Upstash
  * Swagger UI for API interaction

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** *Retrieving of data from database may take some time(<=50 sec) as it's a free service.*

## Technologies Stack
  - **Backend**: FastAPI
  - **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL (Render)
  - **Cache & Queue Broker**: Redis (Upstash)
  - **Async Workers**: Celery + Celery Beat
  - **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
  - **Testing**: Postman/ Command Prompt

## API Usage Examples
- *refer to-* https://newshub-c5r7.onrender.com](https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/docs

---

## Signature Verification
- If a secret is set for a subscription:
  - The service includes X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=... in the outbound request.
  - Incoming payloads (for verification-enabled subscriptions) are rejected with 401 Unauthorized if signature mismatch occurs.

---

## Log Retention
- Delivery logs are stored for 72 hours.
- A periodic task via Celery Beat cleans up old logs automatically.

---

## Architecture Highlights
- FastAPI was chosen for high performance and async capability.
- Celery for background job processing and retries.
- Upstash Redis is used for both caching and message brokering (serverless, low-latency).
- PostgreSQL via Render for reliability and relational consistency.
- Docker Compose enables simple, isolated local development.

- Architecture Choices Explained
üîß Framework: FastAPI
Fast performance with async support
Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger for easy testing
Clean dependency injection system

üß± Database: PostgreSQL (on Render)
Strong consistency and relational integrity
Delivery logs, subscriptions, and retry tracking require structured schema

üîÅ Async Queue: Celery + Redis (Upstash)
Celery workers process webhook deliveries in the background
Redis serves as both broker and cache
Celery Beat schedules cleanup tasks (e.g., log retention)

üîÅ Retry Strategy
Max 5 retries per delivery
Exponential backoff: 10s ‚Üí 30s ‚Üí 1m ‚Üí 5m ‚Üí 15m
Failures logged with error reasons

---

## Assumptions
- Ingestion clients trust the response 202 Accepted and will not retry from their end.
- Subscriptions are pre-created via API before ingestion is attempted.
- Redis is available and accessible via provided URL (Upstash or local Docker).
