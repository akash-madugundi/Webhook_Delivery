# Webhook Delivery Service

A robust backend system for managing webhook subscriptions, ingesting and delivering webhooks asynchronously with retries, signature verification, logging, caching, and status tracking.

#### üåê Live Demo - [Backend Service](https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/docs)

---

## Features
  * Subscription Management (CRUD)
  * Asynchronous Webhook Ingestion and Delivery
  * HMAC-SHA256 Signature Verification
  * Delivery Logging with Retry (Exponential Backoff)
  * Caching with Redis (Upstash)
  * Log Retention Cleanup
  * Status & Analytics Endpoints
  * Dockerized (with docker-compose)
  * Deployed on Render + Upstash
  * Swagger UI for API interaction

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** *Retrieving of data from database may take some time(<=50 sec) as it's a free service.*

## API Usage Examples
- *refer to-* [https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/docs]
- #### On Windows (cmd prompt)
  - POST target_url and secret_key -> returns subscription_id
  ```
  curl -X POST https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/subscriptions/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"target_url\": \"https://webhook.site/81ac3c91-dca3-46ed-aa17-191b2ff689f4\", \"secret\": \"secretkey1\" }"
  ```
  - Verify Subscription ID 
  ```
  curl -X GET https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/subscriptions/a2fede6b-2eb6-4336-bb1a-3c7e0d2d0e3b
  ```
  - POST Payload to Subscription ID -> returns delivery_id
  ```
  curl -X POST https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/ingest/a2fede6b-2eb6-4336-bb1a-3c7e0d2d0e3b -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"event\": \"sent_payload\", \"user_id\": 1 }"
  ```
  - GET delivery-status
  ```
  curl -X GET https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/subscription/a2fede6b-2eb6-4336-bb1a-3c7e0d2d0e3b/recent-deliveries
  ```
  - Check cached subscription
  ```
  curl -X GET https://webhook-delivery.onrender.com/cache/a2fede6b-2eb6-4336-bb1a-3c7e0d2d0e3b
  ```

## Architecture Highlights
  - Framework: FastAPI
    - Fast performance with async support
    - Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger for easy testing
    - Clean dependency injection system
  - Database: PostgreSQL (on Render)
    - Strong consistency and relational integrity
    - Delivery logs, subscriptions, and retry tracking require structured schema
  - Async Queue: Celery + Redis (Upstash)
    - Celery workers process webhook deliveries in the background
    - Redis serves as both broker and cache
    - Celery Beat schedules cleanup tasks (e.g., log retention)
  - Retry Strategy
    - Max 5 retries per delivery
    - Exponential backoff: 10s ‚Üí 30s ‚Üí 1m ‚Üí 5m ‚Üí 15m
    - Failures logged with error reasons
  - Others
    - Signature Verification: The service includes X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=... in the outbound request.
    - Log Retention: A periodic task via Celery Beat cleans up old logs automatically (stored for 72hrs).

## Assumptions
- Ingestion clients trust the response 202 Accepted and will not retry from their end.
- Subscriptions are pre-created via API before ingestion is attempted.
- Redis is available and accessible via provided URL (Upstash or local Docker).
